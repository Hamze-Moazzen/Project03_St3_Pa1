# Project03_St3_Pa1
This project investigates bistability and hysteresis in the proximity-based grouping of dot lattices. This repository contains data and code organized into two main folders:
  1) Data Analysis & Modeling: This section contains MATLAB codes for data processing and model simulation:\n
       a) Extract Model Parameters: Codes to prepare data for further analysis, specifically to extract parameters for the Lotka-Volterra-Haken model from raw data in an Excel input file.
       b) Psychometric Functions: Codes to extract relevant data from raw files, fit psychometric functions, and plot the results.
       c) Bifurcation Curves: Codes to perform numerical simulations of the Lotka-Volterra-Haken model using given parameters and plot the resulting bifurcation curves.
  2) Statistical Analysis: This section contains all materials related to statistical analysis:
       a) Codes: R codes for performing statistical analysis and generating plots of the results.
       b) Data: Contains both raw and processed data used for the statistical analysis.
